      "From familiar childhood movie characters to demigods, Andover students put lots of creativity and thought into their costumes at this year’s Halloween party. The Phillipian interviewed a few students at the party who turned heads with their eye-catching costumes. Which costume is your favorite?\n",

      "\n",
      "“I was struck with the brilliant idea of telling people that I was actually an undercover cop… and that I wasn’t a lifeguard. Because something that I always think is funny at Halloween parties is how people guess what your costume is, so people would be like, ‘Oh, are you a lifeguard?’ and I would be like, ‘No, I’m actually an undercover cop, I’m undercover as a lifeguard.’”\n",

And then for the rest of us, who were playing secret service, we had sunglasses.”\n",

      "Elliot Chung ’24: Squid Game Contestant\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend said I looked a lot like [one of the characters], and I thought it would be a perfect costume, because Emerson [Kington ’24] went to Spirit Halloween and he got a [Squid Games] costume and I decided to wear it… The key points are the green tracksuit because it makes me look like [a character] from Squid Game.”\n",

One of my friends is blonde so we said, ‘Oh you can be Tinkerbell,’ and I guess I look like a Silvermist…We all wore satin-ish silk dresses to make it look cohesive. Mine was blue because Silvermist wears blue and we also had wings that were actually really small. But I think that worked out because if they were big they would have been way too inconvenient, for a fairy. That was it, I put on blue eyeshadow to tie in more blue for Silvermist.”\n",
